# eviline 2

Eviline 2 is an AI engine and simple frontend for a falling blocks game that cannot be mentioned, but involves shapes consisting of four blocks each, and clearing horizontal rows from the playing field when the entire row is filled.  

Eviline 2 sees most of its development in the AI functionality, where the rules of optimization club have been broken without remorse.
> The Rules of Optimization Club
>
>*	The first rule of Optimization Club is, you do not Optimize.
>*	The second rule of Optimization Club is, you do not Optimize without measuring.
>*	If your app is running faster than the underlying transport protocol, the optimization is over.
>*	One factor at a time.
>*	No marketroids, no marketroid schedules.
>*	Testing will go on as long as it has to.
>*	If this is your first night at Optimization Club, you have to write a test case.
